# Changelog

## 0.1.8

- Added direct Home Assistant power sensor ingestion via REST (`power_source: home_assistant_rest`).
- Added configurable sensor mapping (`home_assistant.power_entity_id`, URL, token fallback via `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`).
- Added built-in SQLite storage for readings and detections (`/data/nilm.sqlite3` by default).
- Added detector warm-start from stored readings so adaptive learning survives restarts.
- Hardened SQLite durability for abrupt restarts (`WAL`, `synchronous=FULL`, integrity check, corruption quarantine/recreate).

## 0.1.7

- Added proper Home Assistant add-on UI configuration entries for MQTT, processing, confidence, logging, and update interval.
- Added `devices_json` UI option and parser support for device definitions.
- Clarified in docs that MQTT Discovery works without a separate custom HA integration.

## 0.1.6

- Added configurable `log_level` support for detailed troubleshooting logs.
- Improved runtime error logging in startup, detector execution, and MQTT publishing.
- Removed invalid HTTP health check from the Docker image.
- Fixed container package path so `/app/main.py` can import the `app` package correctly.

## 0.1.5

- Ensured `/app/main.py` exists in the image at runtime.
- Installed Python dependencies before application start.
- Improved Docker copy layout for add-on startup reliability.
